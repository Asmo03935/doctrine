      <template v-slot:title>MOBS</template>
      <template v-slot:content>
        <p>Mobs are almost just like player characters, except they are controlled by the game. But they otherwise behave the same way: they exist within the boundaries of a room, and can execute almost every command that a player can. They can move, fight, pick up stuff. They even have access to some of the builder commands.</p>

        <div class="subtitle-1">Roaming</div>
        <p>Mobs can move around ('mob' is originally short for 'mobile'). Their roaming mehavior depends on how they were loaded.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A mob loaded by a rule targeting a room will remain in that room, unless forced to move.</li>
          <li>A mob loaded by a rule targeting a path will roam anywhere within that path.</li>
          <li>A mob loaded by a rule targeting a zone will roam anywhere in that zone except in No Roam rooms (which is a flag on the room level).</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="subtitle-1">Aggression</div>

        <p>Whether a mob will attack another character depends on its 'aggression' setting, as well as on its faction standing relative to the other character.</p>

          <template v-slot:default>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th class="text-left">Setting</th>
                <th class="text-left">Definition</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Passive</td>
                <td>
                  Mob will never attack, it not even fight back. When a mob is passive, their quest are available to other factions even if they otherwise would be hostile. For example, a passive orc can have a quest that a human can activate.
                </td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>Normal</td>
                <td>
                  Aggression will be determined by faction standing. If the character being considered has a core faction, and the mob has a different core faction, the mob will aggro. Otherwise, it will only attack characters who have a negative standing with one of their non-core factions.
                </td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>Players</td>
                <td>Will attack all players that enter its room.</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>All</td>
                <td>Will attack any other character that enters its room.</td>
              </tr>

        <div class="subtitle-1 mt-4">Stats</div>

        <p>The level of a mob determines:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>How much armor it has: Mobs get 10.25 * L armor, and warrior mobs get triple that amount.</li>
          <li>How much damage it deals: If not wielding a weapon, a mob deals L / 2 physical damage.</li>
          <li>How much experience it gives when being slain. Refer to the <router-link to="/playing/experience">Experience Table</router-link> to view how much experience per mob.</li>
          <li>Its health &amp; stats if using default stats.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If a mob is 'elite', its health will increase 6 fold.</p>
